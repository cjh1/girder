OAuth Login
-----------

This plugin allows users to log in using OAuth against a set of supported providers,
rather than storing their credentials in the Girder instance. Specific instructions
for each provider can be found below.

Google
******

On the plugin configuration page, you must enter a **Client ID** and **Client secret**.
Those values can be created in the Google Developer Console, in the **APIS & AUTH** >
**Credentials** section. When you create a new Client ID, you must enter the
``AUTHORIZED_JAVASCRIPT_ORIGINS`` and ``AUTHORIZED_REDIRECT_URI`` fields. These *must*
point back to your girder instance. For example, if your Girder instance is hosted
at ``https://my.girder.com``, then you should specify the following values: ::

    AUTHORIZED_JAVASCRIPT_ORIGINS: https://my.girder.com
    AUTHORIZED_REDIRECT_URI: https://my.girder.com/api/v1/oauth/google/callback

After successfully creating the Client ID, copy and paste the client ID and client
secret values into the plugin's configuration page, and hit **Save**. Users should
then be able to log in with their Google account when they click the log in page
and select the option to log in with Google.
